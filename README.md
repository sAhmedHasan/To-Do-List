This project involved creating a To-Do List application using the Flet framework and SQLite for database management. I learned how to connect to and manipulate a database to store, retrieve, update, and delete tasks. The application featured a user interface with task entry forms and interactive buttons for adding, editing, and deleting tasks. Through this project, I gained practical experience in database operations, GUI development, and handling user interactions within a desktop application. 

It still has issues with the SQL, but I'm working on fixing that
